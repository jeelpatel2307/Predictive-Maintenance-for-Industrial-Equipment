# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## Overview

This project implements a basic simulation of Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment in Java. The goal is to predict when industrial machinery is likely to fail or require maintenance based on simulated degradation and failure thresholds. While this is a simplified version, in real-world applications, predictive maintenance involves collecting sensor data, preprocessing it, and using machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

## Features

- **Industrial Equipment Simulation:** Simulates the operation of industrial equipment over time, including degradation and failure detection.
- **Predictive Maintenance System:** Demonstrates how predictive maintenance can be implemented to proactively schedule maintenance based on equipment health status.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance-for-industrial-equipment.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Compile and Run:**
    
    ```bash
    cd predictive-maintenance-for-industrial-equipment
    javac PredictiveMaintenanceSystem.java
    java PredictiveMaintenanceSystem
    
    ```
    
3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
    
    Follow the prompts to simulate the operation of industrial equipment and observe how predictive maintenance is triggered based on equipment health status.
    

## Usage

1. **Simulation:**
    
    The simulation runs for a specified number of days, during which the health status of industrial equipment is monitored and maintenance actions are triggered if necessary.
    
2. **Failure Detection:**
    
    Equipment failure is detected when its health status falls below a predefined threshold, indicating that maintenance is required to prevent potential breakdowns.
